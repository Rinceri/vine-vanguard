# Vine Vanguard
A project made during HackSheffield 9, based on the theme of "Growth".

Inspired from Grow Home and Planterra from Terraria, the game involves a plant defending itself from enemies using its dirt bullets, and growing vines from the seeds the enemies drop. The flower of the plant can traverse across the vines, and must reach a purple "node" to win the game.

The game will still be worked on in the future, and to view the submitted project, view the [hackathon-final](https://github.com/UniverseSquared/hacksheffield9/releases/tag/hackathon-final) tag from the source project.

## How to play
Use WASD keys to move the flower across the vines.

To grow a vine, make sure you have alteast two seeds and left click on a green node. Note that the flower has a certain radius to be able to click on any node, so make sure you are as close as possible to the node you click!

Right click to shoot enemies to gather seeds. Work fast otherwise you can die and lose the game!

Yellow nodes are collectibes, and can be clicked on to collect them. At the current stage of development, they have no use.

Note, if you die, you may encounter an error saying "You died"; that is completely normal and just start the game to start a new game.
